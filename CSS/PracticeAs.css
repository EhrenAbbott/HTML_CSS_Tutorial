/* 2. If you have an image inside of a div and want to create some space 
above the image, would you add the margin to the image or to the div it 
sits inside? Why?

You would add the margin to the div because if its content gets changed, for example 
if the image is replaced with another element such as a video, the margin
stylign would remain and would not be applied to an element that is subject 
to change.

/* 3. Create a CSS rule that applies to a general element.
    Apply the same rule to a class. */

    /* div { 
        margin-top: 100px;
    }

    .main { 
        margin-top: 100px;
    } */

/* NOTE: There are different conventions for naming classes for HTML elements, so 
there is not necessarily one universal preference, but rather it will vary depending on
the company and the project 
- Critically, the browser will automatically apply some minimal styling to your page, 
such as a margin around the body element. To get rid of this, you would simply 
target the body in the CSS file and explicitly set the margin to zero.
- It is also important to note that if you have vertically stacked divs and you 
you add a margin to the bottom of the top div, and a margin to the top fo the bottom div, 
the result will *NOT* but a sum of the two margins, but rather they will collapse into each
other, and the larger margin will always take precedence while the smaller 
margin is essentially not applied. There are some specific scenarios where this is not
exactly the case, but that is generally not the case.

/* 4. Create a CSS rule to horizontally center an element inside its parent div */

/* img { 
    display: block; 
    width: 200px; 
    margin-left: auto; 
    margin-right: auto;
} */


/* NOTE: There are three conditions that need to be in place to center elements: 
    1. The display property must be set to block-- an element cannot center itself if it
    doesn't control full control of the horizontal space.
    2. The element must have a width; an element cannot be centered inside the browser if it
    is larger than the browser itself
    3. The left and right margin of the element must be set to auto; set a single margin to auto
    means that it takes up ALL of the available space on that side. Setting both sides to auto
    means that all of the available space within the element will be evenly divided between the 
    right and left margin.

/* 5. Assuming text within a div that has a grey background, what CSS styling would you add 
to make it so that there is space between the text (on all sides) and the edge of the div element? */

/* div { 
    padding: 20px;
} */

/*SEE: padding definition

/* ######################################################################################## */

/* 6. Assume you have two buttons that you want to be dispalyed inline, 
but you also want them to be vertically aligned with the other elements above and below
them, as well as horizontally aligned to appear next to each other in the middle of the line 
they occupy. How woudl you accomplish this?

.parent-div { 
    text-align: center;
 }

 .btn { 
    *REMOVE DISPLAY PROPERTY*
 }

/* NOTE: recall that to center something horizontally you need to set the display to 
block and the left and right margins to auto. However, this display attribute 
inherently means that the buttons will be stacked on top of one another. To work around this, 
you can remove the block display from the buttons and give the parent div the text-align property
and set it to center. 
-Importantly, the text-align property is a bit of a misnomer, as works on *ALL* inline elements, 
*NOT* just on text.

/* !VOCAB!  */

/* selector: */
/* -- The CSS syntactic component that indicates which element the styling will be applied to:*/

/* rule */
/* --This is the CSS term that refers to the HTML element
being targeted (the selector) as well as the specific part of the 
element that is to be changed and how it will be changed

/* property: */ 
/*--The specific part of the HTML element that the CSS rule is targeting, 
such as color, margin, border etc. 

/* value: */ 
/*--The styling that will be applied to the preceeding property. For example, 
in a CSS rule, background would be a property, and the specific color 
, such as blue, would be the value

/* margin */ 
/* This is spacing aroudn the *OUTSIDE* of an element. It really just serves to create 
/* room in between different elements for visual appeal.


/* padding */ 
/* This is similar to a margin except it adds space on the *INTERIOR* of an element, 
so if a div has padding, space will be added between the content, such as text, and the
edges of the container.


/* hex color code */ 
/* This is a value of the various color properties in CSS that  starts with a
hashtag and is followed by six letters and/or numbers. This is another way of indicating 
colors and is essentially a recipe for a color that indicates how much red, green, and blue to 
add.

/* inline elements */ 
/* HTML elements that are displayed next to one another (horizontally). 
Some elements, such as buttons, are inline by default.

/* block elements */ 
/* HTML elements that stack up on top of one another (vertically). 
A block level element blocks our the rest of the available space on the 
horizontal axis so that nothing else can be placed there. So, if you have a column 
of images aligned to the left of a page and they are only taking up a portion of 
the screen, the area to the right of the images' respective container(s) will be blocked off so
no other elements can be positioned there, regardless of the width of the image. 

/* class */ 
/* This is a built in HTML attribute that can be added to any element. They value 
can be whatever you want it to be and the function of a class is to organize 
similar elements that will have the same styling so as to avoid applying the styling 
to a general element, such as div, which would instead apply that styling to
every div that exists on the page.

/* the box model */ 
/* This refers to the interplay of spacing in and around an element 
(from outside to inside); margin, border, padding, content

/* !PRINCIPLES AND BEST PRACTICES OF DESIGN! */
/* -It is good practice not to have pure black text displayed on a pure white backgroun, 
as this is unpleasant on the eyes. Instead you could modify one or both to make them
a couple of shades darker than white or lighter than black
- Buttons will typically have more padding on the right and left hand sides than 
on the top and bottom
- When thinking about the height/width of an element it is important to take the 
box model into consideration; the total height of an input field, for example, won't just 
be the height of the field, but rather it will appear as that element's height *PLUS*
the pixels occupies by the padding, border, and margins.
- When setting the height for an input field, some browsers will not honor the 
CSS height rule, so it is better to use the line-height property combined with padding; 
the line-height property literally refers to the height of a line of text, and since text 
is the only thing that goes in an input field, setting the line height is the 
equivalent of setting the height of the inner content of the input field.
- It is good to have a contrast ratio of 4.5 or higher to make elements 
accessible for people who are visually impaired. The ratio can be checked by going to
userway.org/contrast and putting in the foreground and background colors of an element
