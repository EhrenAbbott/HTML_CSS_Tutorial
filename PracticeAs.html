1. Write the appropriate tag to add an image to a page. 
    Within the tag, make the image scale to the size of the page

<img src="photo.jpg" width="100%">

NOTE: Wheras a p tag will take up the entire width of the window automatically, the image tag 
will only display a picture that takes up the space it needs based on the file size. Setting the image 
to 100% meaning that it will occupy 100% of the current window size, regardless of how
large of small that is, and the image will scale accordingly when the window grows or shrinks. 
This is a sort of hack, as it can/should be done with CSS bc that is dedicated to styling.
NOTE: the src attribute can be a file, but it can also be the wed address of an image from a site. This can 
be accessed by right clicking on an image and choosing 'copy image address'. This can be pasted 
directly in the img attribute. Although this is a good, quick way to access 
images from the internet, this is considered *BAD PRACTICE* and shouldn't be done 
in actual projects. See: hot-linking for more information.

2. Create a spot on a page that allows the user to type something in. 
    Make it so that there is preexisting text in that spot that they can 
    write over. 
    Now do the same but have the user's text be masked/hidden.
    Again but allow the user to select from a dropdown calendar. 
    Again but allow the user to pick a time. 
    Again but have a color palette drop down that allow's the user 
    to select a color.
    Once more but make a spot to upload something.

<input type="text" placeholder="write here!">
<input type="password">
<input type="date">
<input type="time">
<input type="color">
<input type="file">

3. Write a sentence and have only one word in that sentence link to a website
    that opens in a new tab

<p>Your sentence 
    <a href="google.com" target="_blank">here</a>
</p>

NOTE: The indentation/spacing is just to make it more easy to read/ follow visually 
It would work the same if it were all on one line.

heading: 
- HTML text tags that are used to create larger text titles/subtitles of
text to accompany larger chunks of writing. h1 is the largest and the 
sizes of header decrease as the numbers after the h increas.
- Note that broken or arbitrary headings just for styling purposes should be used; 
for example you shouldn't use an h3 tag after only first using an h1 tag, and you 
shouldn't choose the heading just because of the resulting font size. Headings 
should follow a logical an sequential order to maintain a clear structure for the content. 
The appropriate usage of elements is also important for accesibility and SEO.

self-closing tag: 
- a tag such as the one used to create an image element that does not require a pair of tags, 
but rather just a single tag. Note that <img> and <img/> are both valid for a self closing tag,
and the  forward slash is optional.

hot-linking: 
- this refers to the practise of using a direct link of an image file hosted on another website.
- it is considered *BAD PRACTICE* bc it is essentially stealing content and bandwidth from another 
site, especially if the image is copyrighted. It is also not reliable bc if the host site
deletes the file or changes its URL, it will result in broken imags on your site. Search images 
like Google may even penalize sites that use hot-linking in their SEO.
With this in mind, it is advised to host your own file or use lciensed content that allow 
embedding or sharing.

child: 
- an element that exists within another element 

parent:
- an elements that contains another element within it

nesting: 
- refers to the placement of element inside other elements. 
- An element nested inside of another is the child element to the parent
element in which it is nested.

div: 
-stands for "divider" and is an element that functions as a container for
other elements. It does not affect the layout or have any visual presence, 
but rather its purpose is to allow us to target its contents to style them with 
CSS or manipulate them with JS.

anchor tag:
-the HTML element that creates links: <a>Link</a>
