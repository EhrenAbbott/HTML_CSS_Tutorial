1. Write the appropriate tag to add an image to a page. 
    Within the tag, make the image scale to the size of the page

<img src="photo.jpg" width="100%">

NOTE: Wheras a p tag will take up the entire width of the window automatically, the image tag 
will only display a picture that takes up the space it needs based on the file size. Setting the image 
to 100% meaning that it will occupy 100% of the current window size, regardless of how
large of small that is, and the image will scale accordingly when the window grows or shrinks. 
This is a sort of hack, as it can/should be done with CSS bc that is dedicated to styling.
NOTE: the src attribute can be a file, but it can also be the wed address of an image from a site. This can 
be accessed by right clicking on an image and choosing 'copy image address'. This can be pasted 
directly in the img attribute. Although this is a good, quick way to access 
images from the internet, this is considered *BAD PRACTICE* and shouldn't be done 
in actual projects. See: hot-linking for more information.

heading: 
- HTML text tags that are used to create larger text titles/subtitles of
text to accompany larger chunks of writing. h1 is the largest and the 
sizes of header decrease as the numbers after the h increas.
- Note that broken or arbitrary headings just for styling purposes should be used; 
for example you shouldn't use an h3 tag after only first using an h1 tag, and you 
shouldn't choose the heading just because of the resulting font size. Headings 
should followe a logical an sequential order to maintain a clear structure for the content. 
The appropriate usage of elements is also important for accesibility and SEO.

self-closing tag: 
- a tag such as the one used to create an image element that does not require a pair of tags, 
but rather just a single tag. Note that <img> and <img/> are both valid for a self closing tag,
and the  forward slash is optional.

hot-linking: 
- this refers to the practise of using a direct link of an image file hosted on another website.
- it is considered *BAD PRACTISE* bc it is essentially stealing content and bandwidth from another 
site, especially if the image is copyrighted. It is also not reliable bc if the host site
deletes the file or changes its URL, it will result in broken imags on your site. Search images 
like Google may even penalize sites that use hot-linking in their SEO.
With this in mind, it is advised to host your own file or use lciensed content that allow 
embedding or sharing.
